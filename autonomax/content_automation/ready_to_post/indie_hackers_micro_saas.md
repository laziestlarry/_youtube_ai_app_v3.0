# From $0 to $500 MRR: My No-Code Micro-SaaS Journey

I launched my first Micro-SaaS 6 months ago with zero coding experience.

Here's the brutally honest breakdown:

## The Idea

I noticed people in my network constantly asking how to automate their business operations. Instead of answering individually, I thought: "What if I productized this?"

**The insight:** Don't build what YOU want. Build what people are ALREADY paying for in other ways (consultants, manual work, etc.)

## The Build (No-Code Stack)

- **Frontend:** Webflow ($29/month)
- **Backend/DB:** Airtable ($20/month)
- **Automations:** Make.com ($16/month)
- **Payments:** Stripe (2.9% + $0.30)
- **Email:** ConvertKit (free tier)

Total monthly cost: ~$65

**Build time:** 3 weekends (about 40 hours total)

## The Launch

I didn't do a big "launch day."

Instead, I:
1. Posted in 3 relevant communities (here, Reddit, Twitter)
2. Reached out to 20 people who had asked me about automation
3. Offered lifetime deals to first 10 customers

First sale came on day 4. From someone I'd never talked to before.

## The Numbers (Month 6)

- **MRR:** $487
- **Customers:** 23
- **Churn:** 8.5%
- **Time spent/week:** ~5 hours (mostly support)

## What I Learned

1. **Validation > Building.** I spent 2 weeks talking to potential customers before building anything.

2. **Simple > Feature-rich.** My product does ONE thing well. That's it.

3. **Support = Marketing.** Every support ticket is a chance to build loyalty and get referrals.

4. **No-code is not "lesser."** My customers don't care how it's built. They care that it works.

## What's Next

- Aiming for $1K MRR by month 9
- Adding 2 integrations customers requested
- Exploring affiliate partnerships

## My Ask

If you're building something similar or have questions about no-code SaaS, drop them below. Happy to share more details.

And if you've been sitting on an idea, consider this your sign to start. The worst that happens is you learn a ton.
