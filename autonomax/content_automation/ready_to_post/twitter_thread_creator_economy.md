🧵 I spent 2 years studying successful creators.

Here are 7 systems they ALL use (that nobody talks about):

1/ CONTENT BATCHING

They don't create daily.
They batch 1-2x per week.

Result: 3x more content, 50% less time.

2/ IDEA CAPTURE SYSTEM

Every idea goes into ONE place.
No more "I had this great idea but forgot it."

Tools: Notion, Apple Notes, voice memos.

3/ TEMPLATE LIBRARIES

They don't start from scratch.
They have templates for:
- Hooks
- Stories
- CTAs
- Thumbnails

4/ ANALYTICS RITUALS

Weekly 30-min review:
- What performed?
- What flopped?
- What to double down on?

5/ AUDIENCE RESEARCH

They don't guess what to create.
They ask:
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you pay to learn?

6/ MONETIZATION STACK

Multiple income streams:
- Digital products
- Sponsorships
- Services
- Community

One viral post = multiple revenue sources.

7/ REST PROTOCOLS

Burnout kills creators.
Scheduled breaks = sustainable growth.

TLDR:
- Batch content
- Capture ideas
- Use templates
- Review analytics
- Research audience
- Diversify income
- Schedule rest

Which one are you implementing first?
