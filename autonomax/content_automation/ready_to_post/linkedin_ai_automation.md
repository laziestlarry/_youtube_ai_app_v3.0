I've automated 80% of my business operations this year.

Here's the uncomfortable truth about AI automation:

Most people are using AI wrong.

They're:
→ Copy-pasting ChatGPT outputs directly
→ Using generic prompts that give generic results
→ Treating AI as a magic button instead of a tool

What actually works:

1. Build AI into WORKFLOWS, not one-off tasks
   Create systems that run without you.

2. Train AI on YOUR context
   Generic AI = generic results.
   Feed it your brand voice, your data, your goals.

3. Automate the boring, amplify the creative
   Let AI handle research, formatting, scheduling.
   You focus on strategy and relationships.

The result?
→ 4 hours of work gives 40 hours of output
→ Consistent quality without burnout
→ More time for high-value activities

This is what I help solopreneurs build.

What's one task you wish you could automate?
