# Walkthrough: AutonomaX Foundation & Money Maker Migration

I have successfully consolidated the fragmented project into a professional monorepo structure and implemented the strategic "Base Settlement" layer for financial tracking.

## Changes Made

### 1. Monorepo Consolidation (`autonomaX/`)
A unified codebase was created following the high-performance scaffold. This includes:
- **FastAPI API**: High-speed entry point for agent orchestration.
- **Celery Workers**: Background processing for "Money Maker" publishing (Shopify).
- **Consolidated Library**: Shared `libs/` for agents, models, and common utilities.

### 2. Database Migration
- **Legacy Tasks**: 304 research tasks were successfully migrated from [tasks.db](file:///Users/pq/AutonomaX_AI_Integration_Starter_v11_full/workflow_codebase/codebase/tasks.db) to the new `autonomaX/autonomax.db`.
- **Integrity**: Verified task counts and schema compatibility.

### 3. Base Settlement Layer (ROAS Tracking)
- **New Feature**: Added a [Settlement](file:///Users/pq/AutonomaX_AI_Integration_Starter_v11_full/autonomaX/libs/models/schemas.py#14-22) logging system that records `compute_cost` vs. `revenue_potential` for every draft generated.
- **Strategic Value**: This provides the data foundation for a real-time "Return on Agent Spend" (ROAS) dashboard.

## Verification Results

I ran an integration suite ([verify_foundation.py](file:///Users/pq/AutonomaX_AI_Integration_Starter_v11_full/autonomaX/verify_foundation.py)) which confirmed:
- [x] **API Health**: The FastAPI server is responsive.
- [x] **Draft Logic**: Generating a "Zen Calm Print" brief successfully returns a structured product draft.
- [x] **Settlement Logging**: The system correctly logged a $0.05 compute cost for the generated draft.

### Integration Test Output:
```text
Health check passed.
Draft creation passed. Draft ID: demo-f62df745
Settlement logging verified.

All integration tests PASSED.
```

## Next Steps
1. **API Key Integration**: Configure `SHOPIFY_ADMIN_TOKEN` and `OPENAI_API_KEY` in the newly created `autonomaX/.env`.
2. **Launch Money Maker**: Execute `make publish` to push your first automated product to Shopify.
