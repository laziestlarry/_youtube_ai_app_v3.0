Hey IH! 👋

I'm Larry (yes, Lazy Larry - I own it).

Quick background:
- Spent years grinding 80-hour weeks
- Discovered automation changed everything
- Now work ~20 hours/week with better results

What I'm building:
• AutonomaX - AI business operating system
• Zen Collections - Digital art products
• Various automation templates and playbooks

Currently running a 48-hour sprint to hit my first $500 from digital products.

Here to learn from this community and share what's working.

Questions I'd love input on:
1. What's your best-converting lead magnet format?
2. How do you balance building vs. marketing?

What's everyone working on this week?

Title: How I automated 80% of my solopreneur tasks (breakdown inside)

After years of manual work, I finally mapped out every repetitive task and automated them.

Here's what I automated:
- Customer onboarding (email sequences)
- Order fulfillment (digital delivery)
- Social posting (scheduled content)
- Lead capture (automated follow-up)
- Revenue tracking (dashboard updates)

Time saved: ~30 hours/week

The key wasn't fancy tools - it was documenting processes first, THEN automating.

Happy to share specific workflows if anyone's interested.

What tasks are eating most of your time right now?
