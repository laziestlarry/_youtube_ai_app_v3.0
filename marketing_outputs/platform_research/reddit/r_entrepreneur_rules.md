## KARMA BUILDING STRATEGY

### Phase 1: Comment Only (Days 1-14)
1. Sort by "New" to find posts needing responses
2. Look for questions you can genuinely answer
3. Write detailed, thoughtful comments (3-5 sentences minimum)
4. Share specific experiences when relevant
5. Avoid generic advice ("just work hard")

### Good Comment Types
- "I went through something similar. Here's what worked for me..."
- "Have you considered [specific approach]? When I faced this, I..."
- "One thing that helped me with [problem] was [specific tactic]..."

### Avoid
- One-word responses
- Generic encouragement
- Anything that could be seen as promotional
- AI-generated responses

### Phase 2: First Post (After 10+ Karma)
- Start with a question or discussion prompt
- Share an experience without mentioning your products
- Respond to EVERY comment on your post
- Build relationships, not traffic
