**Digital products are underrated - my journey from $0 to $2K/month passive**

Everyone talks about dropshipping and crypto. Nobody talks about selling what you already know.

**My path:**
1. Started doing AI services (active income)
2. Noticed I was repeating the same processes
3. Documented everything into templates
4. Packaged as digital products
5. Now they sell while I sleep

**What works:**
- Solve a SPECIFIC problem (not "make money online")
- Price based on value, not time
- Automate delivery completely
- Stack products that complement each other

**Current stack:**
- Starter kits: $29-49
- Templates: $19-29  
- Bundles: $97-197

The key? Your first $100 teaches you more than any course.

Anyone else building digital product income?
