Hey everyone! 👋

Quick question for the group:

How many of you have thought about turning your expertise into a digital product but haven't started yet?

I was in that boat for 2 years. Kept telling myself:
- "Who would buy this?"
- "It's not good enough yet"
- "I need to learn more first"

Finally just DID it. Took my AI automation workflows and packaged them into starter kits.

Result? People are actually buying them. 🤯

The lesson: Your "obvious" knowledge is valuable to someone 2 steps behind you.

Anyone else working on productizing their skills? Would love to hear what's holding you back (or what's working!).

PS: If you're in the AI/automation space, I put together a toolkit that might help. Link in comments if interested.
