**Show Reddit: Built a toolkit for AI freelancers after struggling myself**

Hey everyone! Long-time lurker, first time posting a project.

**The problem I had:**
Started doing AI automation gigs on Fiverr. Got overwhelmed with:
- Writing unique gig descriptions
- Figuring out pricing
- Managing client communication
- Delivering consistently

**What I built:**
A starter kit with templates, scripts, and workflows specifically for AI service providers.

**Includes:**
- 10 proven gig description templates
- Pricing calculator with market data
- Client communication scripts
- Delivery workflow automation

Would love feedback from anyone in the freelance/AI space. What would make this more useful?

Link in profile if curious.
