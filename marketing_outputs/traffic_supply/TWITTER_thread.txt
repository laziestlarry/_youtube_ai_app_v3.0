I turned my freelance grind into a product business in 6 months.

Went from trading hours for dollars to selling systems that work without me.

Here's the exact playbook 🧵

TWEET 2:
Step 1: Document EVERYTHING

Every time I did something twice, I made a template.

- Client onboarding? Template.
- Proposal writing? Template.
- Delivery process? Template.

Boring? Yes. Life-changing? Also yes.

Step 2: Find the patterns

After 50+ clients, I noticed:
- 80% wanted the same 3 things
- 90% had the same objections
- 95% asked the same questions

Your "unique" clients aren't that unique.

Step 3: Package the solution

Took my templates and turned them into products:

- Starter Kit: $49 (entry point)
- Full System: $149 (main offer)
- Premium Bundle: $497 (for serious buyers)

Digital delivery = zero marginal cost.

Step 4: Automate delivery

Every product is:
- Instant download
- Self-serve support (FAQ/docs)
- Upsell to next tier

I literally make money while sleeping now.
