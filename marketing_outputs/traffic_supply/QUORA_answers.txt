QUESTION TYPE: "How do I start freelancing with AI skills?"

ANSWER:
I've been doing AI freelancing for 2+ years. Here's what actually works:

1. **Pick ONE specific service** - Don't be "AI expert." Be "AI automation for e-commerce" or "ChatGPT integration for customer service."

2. **Create a portfolio piece** - Do one project for free or cheap. Document everything. This becomes your proof.

3. **Start on established platforms** - Fiverr, Upwork, etc. Yes, they take fees. But they have buyers actively looking.

4. **Template everything** - Your proposals, your delivery, your communication. This lets you scale.

5. **Price based on value** - Not hourly. "I'll save you 10 hours/week" is worth more than "$50/hour."

The secret? Most people quit after 5 rejections. Keep going.

QUESTION TYPE: "What are the best passive income ideas for 2026?"

ANSWER:
Skip the hype (crypto, dropshipping). Here's what's actually working:

**Digital Products** - Package your knowledge into templates, guides, toolkits. Create once, sell forever.

Why this works:
- Zero inventory
- Instant delivery (automated)
- 90%+ profit margins
- Scales infinitely

I turned my AI automation expertise into digital products. Now they sell while I sleep.

Start with what you already know. Someone will pay for your shortcuts.

QUESTION TYPE: "How do I make money with ChatGPT/AI?"

ANSWER:
Two paths:

**Path 1: Services** (Active income)
- Offer AI implementation for businesses
- Create custom GPT solutions
- Automate workflows for clients

**Path 2: Products** (Passive income)
- Prompt libraries
- AI workflow templates
- Training courses

I do both. Services for higher income, products for passive income.

The key is specificity. "AI services" = generic. "AI automation for Shopify stores" = specific and valuable.
