**Tips that 10x'd my AI gig performance**

Been on Fiverr 2+ years doing AI automation services. Here's what actually moved the needle:

**Gig optimization:**
- Title: Include "AI" + specific outcome + timeframe
- First image: Show the RESULT, not the process
- Description: Problem → Solution → Proof → CTA
- FAQ: Address objections before they ask

**Pricing strategy:**
- Basic: Entry point (gets them in)
- Standard: Where you want them (best value messaging)
- Premium: Anchor that makes Standard look reasonable

**Response template:**
"Thanks for reaching out! Based on [their request], I recommend [package] because [specific reason]. I can start [timeframe]. Any questions?"

**Delivery hack:**
Over-deliver on first order → they come back → you upsell
