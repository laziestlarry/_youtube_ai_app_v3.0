# Launching AutonomaX: AI Business Automation Toolkit

Hey IH! 👋

## The Story

I spent 2 years doing AI services on freelance platforms. Made decent money but was drowning in repetitive work - writing proposals, managing clients, creating deliverables from scratch every time.

So I started documenting my systems. Templates, scripts, workflows - everything that made me efficient.

Friends in the AI space kept asking for my "secret sauce." That's when I realized: this IS the product.

## What I Built

**AutonomaX** - A collection of tools for people building AI service businesses:

📦 **Fiverr Starter Kit** ($49)
- 10 proven gig templates
- Pricing strategy guide
- Client communication scripts

📦 **Profit OS** ($149)
- Complete business operating system
- Automation workflows
- Revenue tracking dashboards

📦 **Mastery Bundle** ($497)
- Everything above + consulting templates
- Course creation framework
- Community access

## Current Traction

- 10 products live on Shopier
- First customers this week
- Building in public

## The Ask

1. What would make this more valuable to you?
2. Anyone else productizing their expertise?
3. Feedback on positioning/pricing?

Building this as "Lazy Larry" - the brand is about working smarter, not harder.
