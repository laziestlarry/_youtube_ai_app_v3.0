## Content Piece 1: The Bootstrap Manifesto
**Title:** "Why I'll never raise money (and why you might not need to either)"

**Post:**
Unpopular opinion: Most businesses don't need investors. They need customers.

The VC path:
- Raise money
- Hire fast
- Grow at all costs
- Maybe profit someday
- 90% fail

The bootstrap path:
- Find paying customer
- Deliver value
- Profit from day 1
- Grow sustainably
- Keep 100% ownership

I chose path 2. No regrets.

The internet made it possible to:
- Reach millions for free
- Accept payments instantly
- Deliver products automatically
- Run a business solo

Why would I give up equity for something I can do myself?

What path are you on?

## Content Piece 2: The $100 Startup Challenge
**Title:** "Start a business this week for under $100"

**Post:**
You don't need:
- ❌ A perfect website ($0 - use free tools)
- ❌ Business cards ($0 - it's 2026)
- ❌ LLC (yet) ($0 - start as sole prop)
- ❌ Office ($0 - work from anywhere)
- ❌ Employees ($0 - start solo)

You DO need:
- ✅ A problem to solve ($0)
- ✅ Someone willing to pay ($0)
- ✅ A way to accept money ($0-$20)
- ✅ A way to deliver value ($0-$50)
- ✅ Courage to start ($0)

Total: $0-$70

My first product cost $12 (domain). Made $500 first month.

What's really stopping you?

## Content Piece 3: The Profitable From Day 1 Framework
**Title:** "How to make your first $1 before spending $1"

**Post:**
Controversial framework: Don't spend money until you make money.

Step 1: Pre-sell before you build
- "I'm creating X. Would you pay $Y for it?"
- Get 3 yes's with deposits
- NOW build it

Step 2: Use free tools until they limit you
- Google Docs for content
- Canva for design
- Notion for delivery
- Free tiers of everything

Step 3: Reinvest profits only
- Made $500? Spend $100 on tools
- Made $1000? Maybe hire help
- Never spend what you haven't earned

This is slow. This is boring. This is how you build something that lasts.

Who else is building profitably?
