## Content Piece 1: The Income Independence Scale
**Title:** "I rated all my income sources on 'presence required' - here's the uncomfortable truth"

**Post:**
Made a spreadsheet rating my income sources from 1-10:
- 1 = Makes money while I sleep
- 10 = Dies if I stop working

Results:
- Freelance clients: 9/10 (no work = no pay)
- Retainer clients: 7/10 (better but still tied)
- Digital products: 2/10 (sells while I'm hiking)
- Affiliate income: 1/10 (truly passive)

My "highest paying" work scored 9/10. My "lowest paying" scored 2/10.

But here's the math:
- 9/10 income: $5K/month, 160 hours required
- 2/10 income: $800/month, 2 hours required

Per hour? The "low" income wins by 12x.

Now I'm systematically converting 9/10 income into 2/10 income.

What's your income independence score?

## Content Piece 2: The 4-Hour Test
**Title:** "What would happen to your income if you worked only 4 hours next week?"

**Post:**
Thought experiment:

Next week, you can only work 4 hours total. What happens to your income?

If the answer is "it drops to zero" — you don't have a business. You have a job you own.

I failed this test 2 years ago. 100% of my income required my presence.

Today? About 40% would survive. Goal is 80%.

The shift: Stop selling your time. Start selling your systems.

How would YOUR income fare in the 4-hour test?

## Content Piece 3: The Nomad Income Blueprint
**Title:** "How I built income I can run from anywhere (no laptop lifestyle BS)"

**Post:**
I'm not selling a dream here. Building location-independent income is hard.

But here's what actually worked:

Phase 1: Service → Product
- Took my freelance service
- Documented my exact process
- Sold the documentation as a product

Phase 2: One-time → Recurring
- Bundled products into a membership
- Added monthly templates/updates
- $29/month > $500 one-time (over time)

Phase 3: Active → Automated
- Set up evergreen email sequences
- Automated delivery 100%
- Now it runs while I travel

Took 18 months. Not glamorous. But now I work from wherever.

What phase are you in?
