## Content Piece 1: The Expertise Extraction
**Title:** "How to find the product hiding in your expertise"

**Post:**
You have a product inside you. You just can't see it because it feels "obvious."

Here's how to extract it:

Step 1: List every question clients/colleagues ask you repeatedly
Step 2: Write down your answer to each (voice memo → transcribe)
Step 3: Group similar answers into themes
Step 4: Each theme = potential product

Example from my journey:
- Question: "How do you write gig descriptions?"
- My "obvious" answer: [explained my process]
- Product: Gig description template pack

What questions do people always ask YOU?

## Content Piece 2: The Productization Ladder
**Title:** "The 5 levels of productizing your expertise"

**Post:**
Level 1: Done-for-you service
- You do the work
- Highest price, lowest scale
- $$$$ per client

Level 2: Done-with-you consulting
- You guide, they execute
- Medium price, medium scale
- $$$ per client

Level 3: Group programs
- You teach many at once
- Lower price, higher scale
- $$ per person × many people

Level 4: Digital products
- You create once, sell forever
- Lowest price, infinite scale
- $ per sale × unlimited sales

Level 5: Community/Membership
- Recurring value, recurring revenue
- Medium price, high retention
- $$ per month × growing base

Most experts stay at Level 1-2. The leverage is at Level 3-5.

Where are you on the ladder?

## Content Piece 3: The MVP Product Framework
**Title:** "Launch your first digital product this weekend (seriously)"

**Post:**
Overthinking kills more products than bad ideas.

Here's how to launch something by Sunday:

Friday night (2 hours):
- Pick ONE problem you solve repeatedly
- Write the solution as if explaining to a friend
- Don't edit. Just dump knowledge.

Saturday (3 hours):
- Organize into logical sections
- Add a simple template or checklist
- Create basic PDF or Notion doc

Sunday (2 hours):
- Write a simple sales page (problem → solution → price)
- Set up Gumroad/Shopier/Lemonsqueezy
- Post "I made a thing" on social

That's it. 7 hours to your first product.

Is it perfect? No.
Will you learn more from launching than planning? 100%.

What problem could YOU solve by Sunday?
