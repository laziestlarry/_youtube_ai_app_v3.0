## Content Piece 1: AI for Normal People
**Title:** "I'm not technical. Here's how I use AI to run my business."

**Post:**
I can't code. I failed math twice. I still don't really understand how AI "works."

But I use AI every single day to:
- Write first drafts (that I heavily edit)
- Brainstorm ideas (better than alone)
- Create templates (faster iteration)
- Analyze feedback (pattern recognition)
- Automate responses (with human review)

The secret? I don't try to understand the technology. I understand the USE CASES.

AI is like electricity. I don't know how it works. I just know which appliances to plug in.

What's one thing you'd automate if AI "just worked"?

## Content Piece 2: The AI Prompt Library
**Title:** "My 10 most-used AI prompts (steal these)"

**Post:**
After 6 months of daily AI use, these are my go-to prompts:

1. "Act as a [role]. Help me [task]. Ask clarifying questions first."

2. "I'm going to paste [content type]. Summarize the key points in bullet form."

3. "Here's my rough draft. Make it clearer without changing my voice."

4. "Give me 10 variations of this [headline/subject line/CTA]."

5. "What questions would a skeptical customer ask about this?"

6. "Identify the weakest argument in this and suggest how to strengthen it."

7. "Create a template I can reuse for [recurring task]."

8. "What am I missing? What haven't I considered?"

9. "Simplify this for someone with no background in [topic]."

10. "Turn this brain dump into a structured outline."

Save these. Use them. Thank me later.

## Content Piece 3: AI Myths Debunked
**Title:** "5 AI myths that are costing you money"

**Post:**
Myth 1: "AI will replace me"
Reality: AI replaces tasks, not people. The people who use AI replace people who don't.

Myth 2: "I need to be technical"
Reality: If you can write a clear email, you can use AI effectively.

Myth 3: "AI output is good enough to publish"
Reality: AI gives you 70%. Your expertise makes it 100%.

Myth 4: "It's cheating"
Reality: It's a tool. Using a calculator isn't cheating at math.

Myth 5: "It's too late to start"
Reality: We're in the first inning. Most people still aren't using it well.

Which myth held you back?
