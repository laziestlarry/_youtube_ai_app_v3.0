## SCRIPTS FOR GENUINE DMs

### After someone engages with your content:
"Hey [name], thanks for the thoughtful comment on my post about [topic]. 

I checked out your profile - looks like you're working on [their project]. How's that going?

[Genuine question about their work]"

### After multiple interactions:
"Hey [name], we keep crossing paths in [community]. Really enjoy your takes on [topic].

Would love to connect properly. What are you working on these days?"

### When they ask what you do:
"I help [target audience] with [problem]. Been building some tools and resources around it.

But honestly more interested in what you're building. Tell me more about [their thing]."

## REMEMBER

1. **Value first, always** - Every interaction should leave them better off
2. **Patience over pressure** - Trust takes time to build
3. **Genuine over strategic** - People sense inauthenticity instantly
4. **Give more than you take** - 10:1 ratio of giving to asking
5. **Play long games** - One relationship > 100 pitches

The network IS the product. The products are just how you serve the network.
