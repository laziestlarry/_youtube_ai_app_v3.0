## Content Piece 1: The Automation Audit
**Title:** "I spent a week tracking every repetitive task. Here's what I found."

**Post:**
Last week I did something weird: I logged every single task I repeated more than once.

The results shocked me:
- 23 hours/week on tasks I'd done before
- 15 of those hours were copy-paste variations
- 8 hours were "reinventing the wheel"

Then I asked: "What if I just... templated everything?"

Week 1: Created templates for my top 5 repetitive tasks
Week 2: Cut those 23 hours down to 6
Week 3: Used the extra 17 hours to build MORE templates

Now I have a library of 47 templates that basically run my business.

The irony? Building the "lazy" system took more upfront work than just grinding. But the compound effect is insane.

**Question for you:** What's your most repeated task that you haven't automated yet?

## Content Piece 2: The 80/20 of Automation
**Title:** "You don't need fancy tools. You need boring systems."

**Post:**
Hot take: Most "automation" advice is overengineered BS.

You don't need:
- Zapier with 47 zaps
- A custom AI agent
- Complex workflows

You DO need:
- A text file with your most-used replies
- A folder of templates you actually use
- A checklist for repeated processes

I made more money from a Google Doc of email templates than from any fancy automation tool.

Start boring. Scale fancy.

## Content Piece 3: The Time Audit Challenge
**Title:** "Challenge: Track your time for 3 days. I'll share what to do with the data."

**Post:**
Here's a challenge that changed my business:

For the next 3 days, write down:
1. Every task you do
2. How long it takes
3. Whether you've done it before (Y/N)

That's it. No apps needed. Just a notes app.

After 3 days, look for:
- Tasks marked "Y" that took >30 min → TEMPLATE THESE
- Tasks you did 3+ times → AUTOMATE THESE
- Tasks you hate but can't avoid → DELEGATE THESE

Reply with your biggest surprise from the audit. I'll share how I'd tackle each one.
