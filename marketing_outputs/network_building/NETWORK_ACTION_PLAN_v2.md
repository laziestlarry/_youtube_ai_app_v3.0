## CRITICAL UPDATE: Platform Prequalification Research

**BEFORE acting on ANY platform, research and document:**
1. Account requirements (karma, age, verification)
2. Content rules (AI policy, promotion policy, link policy)
3. Community culture (what resonates, what gets banned)
4. Gatekeeping mechanisms (karma gates, mod approval)
5. Best posting times and formats

| Subreddit | Required Karma | Current Karma | Status | Notes |
|-----------|----------------|---------------|--------|-------|

## REDDIT-SPECIFIC PROTOCOL

### DO:
- Read subreddit rules before ANY action
- Build karma through genuine, helpful comments
- Share experiences authentically (human voice)
- Wait for karma requirements before posting
- Contribute value without expecting return

### DO NOT:
- Post before meeting karma requirements
- Use AI-generated content (detectable, bannable)
- Mention products/services until established
- Include links in early engagement
- Cross-post same content to multiple subs

### Comment Strategy for Karma Building:
1. Find posts asking questions you can genuinely answer
2. Write thoughtful, detailed responses (not one-liners)
3. Share personal experience when relevant
4. Be helpful without agenda
5. Track karma growth per subreddit
