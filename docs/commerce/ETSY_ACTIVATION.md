# Etsy Activation Checklist

## Status
Use this checklist once listing assets are generated and `marketing_assets/channel_etsy.csv` is ready.

## Steps
1) Create or verify the Etsy shop profile (logo, banner, policies).
2) Upload listing images from `marketing_assets/<SKU>/`.
3) Copy listing metadata from `marketing_assets/channel_etsy.csv`.
4) Set pricing (digital download) and delivery files.
5) Publish 5-10 listings to activate shop search signals.

## Recommended priority SKUs
- HYBRID-STACK-01
- NOTION-PASSIVE-01
- ZEN-ART-BASE

## Notes
- Etsy requires manual upload for files and images.
- Use the listing assets in `marketing_assets/<SKU>/` for main images.
