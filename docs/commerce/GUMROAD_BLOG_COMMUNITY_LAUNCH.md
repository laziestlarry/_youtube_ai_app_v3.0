# Gumroad, Blog, and Community Launch

## Gumroad (digital products)
- Use `marketing_assets/channel_gumroad.csv` for listing copy.
- Upload listing images from `marketing_assets/<SKU>/`.
- Set pricing tiers with a pay-what-you-want floor for entry bundles.

## Blog launch (organic traffic)
- Publish 3 launch posts:
  1) "Hybrid passive income systems that run on autopilot."
  2) "The automation SOPs that saved 10 hours per week."
  3) "Notion dashboards that keep revenue on track."
- Add CTA banners linking to Shopify or Gumroad checkout.

## Reddit and Discord (community-first)
- Reddit: value-first posts, share process screenshots, avoid direct selling.
- Discord: create channels for wins, questions, templates, and resource drops.
- Weekly cadence: 2 value posts + 1 AMA + 1 product teaser.

## Social + email
- Short-form: 15-30 sec clips from the promo videos.
- Email: 5-day warmup sequence with 1 CTA to the starter product.
