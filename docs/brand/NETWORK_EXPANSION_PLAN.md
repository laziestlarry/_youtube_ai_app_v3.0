## Content Bank: Ready-to-Post

### Introduction Posts (Use when joining new communities)

**Template 1 - Indie Hackers Style**:
```
Hey everyone! 👋

I'm Larry - founder of Propulse-AutonomaX.

Background: Spent years in the hustle trap before discovering automation changed everything.

What I'm building:
• AutonomaX - AI business operating system
• Zen Collections - Digital art that sells itself
• Various automation tools and templates

What I'm looking for:
• Feedback on what's working/not working
• Connections with fellow automation nerds
• Ideas for products the community actually needs

Happy to share what I've learned about building automated income streams.

What's everyone working on?
```

**Template 2 - Reddit Style**:
```
Long-time lurker, first-time poster.

Background: Built a few digital product businesses, obsessed with automation.

Currently working on:
- Digital art products (POD, printables)
- Automation templates and SOPs
- AI-powered business tools

Not here to sell anything - just want to learn from this community and share what's working for me.

What topics are people most interested in when it comes to automation?
```

### Value Posts (No selling, just helping)

**Automation Tips Series**:

```
The "Set It and Forget It" email sequence that onboards my customers:

Day 0: Welcome + download links
Day 1: Quick win tutorial
Day 3: "How's it going?" check-in
Day 7: Bonus resource
Day 14: Soft upsell

Total time to set up: 2 hours
Running time: 18 months and counting
Customers onboarded: 500+

Happy to share the actual templates if anyone wants them.
```

```
Tools I use to run my business in ~10 hours/week:

• Shopier - payments and digital delivery
• Notion - everything dashboard
• Zapier - connects everything
• ConvertKit - email automation
• ChatGPT - content assistance
• Canva - quick graphics

Total monthly cost: ~$100
Revenue generated: $X,XXX

The key isn't having the best tools - it's connecting them so they work without you.
```
