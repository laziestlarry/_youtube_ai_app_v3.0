### About Section
```
I'm Lazy Larry - and I wear that title with pride.

Not the "sit on the couch watching Netflix" kind of lazy.
The "I refuse to do the same task twice" kind of lazy.
The "my systems work while I sleep" kind of lazy.

After years of grinding 80-hour weeks, I discovered a secret: The most successful entrepreneurs aren't the hardest workers. They're the best system builders.

So I became obsessed with automation.

Now I build AI-powered systems that:
→ Generate revenue on autopilot
→ Handle customer service 24/7
→ Create and distribute content automatically
→ Scale businesses without scaling headcount

🏢 What I'm Building:

• Propulse-AutonomaX - The holding company for everything we do
• AutonomaX - AI-powered business operating system
• Zen Collections - Digital art that sells itself
• Lazy Larry Productions - Tutorials, courses, coaching

🎯 My Mission:

Help 10,000 solopreneurs escape the hustle trap and build businesses that respect their time.

📦 What I Offer:

🎨 Zen Art Collections - Premium printable wall art (50+ designs)
📋 Creator Kits - Launch your digital product in 7 days
🤖 Automation Playbooks - SOPs, templates, workflows
🎓 1:1 Coaching - Learn to be productively lazy

💬 Let's Connect:

Whether you're drowning in tasks or ready to automate - I'd love to chat.

DM me "LAZY" and I'll send you my free Automation Starter Kit.

Remember: Work smarter, not harder. Let the machines do the work.

I spent 5 years grinding 80-hour weeks.

Then I discovered: The laziest entrepreneurs are often the richest.

Not lazy in ambition. Lazy in repetition.

Here's my system for building income that doesn't require my attention:

Hey everyone! 👋

I'm Larry (yes, Lazy Larry - I own it).

I'm the founder of Propulse-AutonomaX, and I'm on a mission to help solopreneurs escape the hustle trap.

My story: I spent years grinding 80-hour weeks, thinking that's what success required. Then I discovered automation, and everything changed.

Now I build systems that:
✅ Generate income while I sleep
✅ Handle customer service automatically
✅ Create and distribute content on autopilot

I'm here to learn from this community and share what's working for me.

Currently building:
• AutonomaX - AI business operating system

Happy to answer any questions about automation, digital products, or productive laziness!

What's everyone working on?
