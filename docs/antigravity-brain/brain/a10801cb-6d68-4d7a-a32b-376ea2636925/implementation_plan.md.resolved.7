# Implementation Plan - Project Ignite 🚀

Build and activate the commercialization engine for the YouTube AI App v3.0, focusing on the "AI Agency" framework and "Land Ignite" earnings modules.

## User Review Required

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This phase modifies the architecture by adding a new `modules/ai_agency/` directory. It also enhances the frontend dashboard to include real-time revenue tracking and a premium "Sculpture Next" design.

## Proposed Changes

### [AI Agency Framework]

#### [NEW] [direction_board.py](file:///Users/pq/_youtube_ai_app_v3.0/modules/ai_agency/direction_board.py)
A central orchestrator that manages departmental AI agents (Marketing, Development, Support).

#### [NEW] [chimera_engine.py](file:///Users/pq/_youtube_ai_app_v3.0/modules/ai_agency/chimera_engine.py)
Multi-model backend support. It allows the app to flip between Ollama and Cloud APIs based on task complexity (The "Chimera" concept).

#### [NEW] [altered_self.py](file:///Users/pq/_youtube_ai_app_v3.0/modules/ai_agency/altered_self.py)
Logic to personalize AI responses based on the creator's YouTube channel history and performance data.

---

### [Earnings & Monetization (Land Ignite)]

#### [MODIFY] [auth.py](file:///Users/pq/_youtube_ai_app_v3.0/backend/api/routes/auth.py)
Enhance `/login-with-key` to properly track usage limits based on whether the key is "Early Bird" or "Master".

#### [MODIFY] [RevenueDashboard.tsx](file:///Users/pq/_youtube_ai_app_v3.0/frontend/src/components/RevenueDashboard.tsx)
Upgrade the UI with "Sculpture Next" aesthetics (animations, glassmorphism) and real-time data from the backend.

---

### [Core App Cleanup]

#### [MODIFY] [Makefile](file:///Users/pq/_youtube_ai_app_v3.0/Makefile)
Add `ignite` target to launch the AI Agency modules alongside the main app.

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
- `pytest backend/tests/test_ai_agency.py`
- Validate `chimera_engine` switching logic.

### Manual Verification
- Log in with an "Early Bird" key and verify the Dashboard shows correct tiered limits.
- Use the new "AI Agency" tab to generate a marketing strategy and verify it uses the creator's "Altered Self" profile.
